# My Hobbies 

## My Scouting Expierence 
### Eagle Scout Rank Achieved in June 2021

One of my hobbies is spending time outdoors or just doing something productive outdoors. Ever since I joined Cub Scouts in the 1st grade until I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in June of 2021 I always have always been drawn to the outdoors. In the summer of 2021 (right after my high school graduation) I had the oppurunity to go on a backpacking trip to a high adventure camp in New Mexico called Philmont. It was a 2 week journey in the backcountry on New Mexico. At the end we hiked over 120 miles in 2 weeks and ranged in elevation from  6,500 to 12,441 feet. 

Here is a picture of me at the top of **Tooth of Time** at the end of the treck:

This is what the entrance of Philmonts basecamp looks like:
